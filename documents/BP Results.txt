1) Running the IEEE paper model (bij) for 3 nodes, p=0.025 and e=0.01, the solution is:

CPLEX 12.6.2.0: optimal integer solution; objective 3
2824 MIP simplex iterations
901 branch-and-bound nodes
No basis.
CB :=
1 2   1
1 3   0
2 1   0
2 3   1
3 1   1
3 2   0

Running the same number of nodes, p=0.025 and e=0.01 but using BP model with N=10000 scenarios, the result is:

Buffer probability-based backup model

2) I incerased and decresed e (epsilon) value with no difference in the final solution. On the other hand, when I decreased p to p=0.005:
